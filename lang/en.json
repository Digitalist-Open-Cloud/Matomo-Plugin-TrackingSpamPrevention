    "SettingMaxActionsTitle": "Max actions per visit to record",
    "SettingMaxActionsDescription": "Enter 0 to allow unlimited actions (default). Most sites have under normal circumstances never say more than say 100 or 200 or 300 actions within one visit. It many cases it might be therefore safe to assume that if someone has caused more actions than the configured amount of actions, then it might be actually tracking spam, or a bot, or something else unnatural causing these actions. Matomo will in this case stop recording further actions for that visit to have less inaccurate data and to reduce server load. The IP address of this visit will then be blocked for up to 24 hours.",
    "SettingNotificationEmailTitle": "Notification email",
    "SettingNotificationEmailDescription": "This email address will be notified whenever an IP is banned because of having too many actions. In the future further notification reasons might be added.",
    "SettingBlockCloudTitle": "Block tracking requests from Cloud",
    "BlockCloudNoteInternetDisabled": "As internet is disabled in Matomo configuration, this feature won't work.",
    "BanIpNotificationMailSubject": "An IP was banned as too many actions were tracked.",
    "SettingBlockCloudDescription": "If enabled, it will block tracking requests that originated from Cloud providers like AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean, Google Cloud and Orcle. If you are only tracking using the JavaScript tracker then this setting should be safe to enable as tracking requests from humans would not originate from these clouds. The setting applies to all your sites. Enabling this feature will cause your server to fetch the up to date list of IP ranges from Google, AWS and Azure servers."
